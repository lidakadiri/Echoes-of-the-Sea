        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p>On a remote island battered by restless tides, Isla, a young marine biologist 
          begins hearing whispers from the deep, haunting voices that no one else can hear.
          Drawn into the ocean’s mysteries, they uncover fragments of a long-lost civilisation 
          swallowed by the sea and bound to an ancient guardian. As dreams blur into reality 
          and the whispers grow louder, they must decide whether to embrace the call of the deep
          or risk unleashing a forgotten power upon the world above.
        </p>
        <p>Blending myth and science, Echoes of the Sea is a cinematic journey into the 
          unknown, where the ocean is both sanctuary and threat, and every wave carries a
          secret older than memory itself.
        </p>

      <section><h2>Director’s Vision</h2>
        <p>Echoes of the Sea was born from a fascination with the spaces where human 
          imagination collides with the natural world. For the director, the ocean has always
          been more than a backdrop—it is a living presence, a force that holds memory, history,
          and mystery within its depths.
        </p>
        <p>Her vision was to create a film that treats the sea not just as setting, but as a 
          character in its own right: alluring, dangerous, and deeply ancient. By weaving 
          together myth, fantasy, and science, she sought to immerse audiences in a story that
          feels both timeless and urgent—a reminder of how much we have forgotten, and how much
          remains hidden beneath the waves.
        </p>

        <h3>Origins of the Idea</h3>
        <p>The spark for the film came during a solitary dive off a rugged coastline where the director
          grew up. Descending into the stillness, she felt surrounded by silence yet overwhelmed by the
          sensation of countless unseen lives. Later, she described it as if “the ocean itself was 
          trying to speak.” That moment became the seed for Echoes of the Sea.

          <h2>Director’s Profile</h2>          
            <p>Amara Vey was born on April 12, 1982, in Monterey, California. Growing up along the 
            Pacific coast, she developed a deep connection to the sea and its stories, 
            often sketching marine life and recording the sounds of waves as a child.
          </p>
          <p>After studying film at UCLA, Amara began her career in documentary filmmaking, 
            exploring themes of nature and human connection. <em>Echoes of the Sea </em>
            is her most personal work yet—drawing on her lifelong fascination with myths 
            of the ocean and her belief that the sea holds both memory and mystery waiting 
            to be uncovered.

  <section class="justifyPls">
      <p>Combining her lifelong love of coastal folklore with her background in documentary filmmaking,
          she began sketching a story that would bridge human vulnerability and oceanic myth. What 
          began as fragments of journal notes and dreamlike images slowly evolved into the tale of a
          lost civilization, a guardian creature, and the voices that refuse to be silenced by time.
